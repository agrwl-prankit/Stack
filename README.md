# Stack

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out) i.e., the element inserted at the last, is the first element to come out of the list.
It is used to retrieve recently used objects, from a cache.
